Identify the differences between the old version and the draft of the new version.\n2. Apply these differences to the old version to produce the new version.\n3. Ensure that the output file is complete and correctly indented.\n4. Replace any placeholder comments with the original code near the placeholder comments.\n5. Remove any unnecessary placeholder comments.\n6. Verify the correctness of the new version of the file by comparing it with the draft of the new version.\n7. Test the new version of the file to ensure that it works as expected.\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}}], "created": 1730753493, "model": "ollama/starcoder2:15b-instruct-32k", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 422, "prompt_tokens": 833, "total_tokens": 1255, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "args": [], "kwargs": {}, "timestamp": 1730753493.4659107, "cost": 0.0}
